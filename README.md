# Card-Dataset-Linear-Discriminant-Analysis

Here I use LDA to understand how best anomalous behaviour can be detected from the labelled dataset where the discriminants are spread across 28 variable with Amount and the Target Variable

I have always been fascinated by the differences between LDA and PCA, and it covers a quick understanding of the same and their differences.
